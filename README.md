Sample code from an Introduction to Java class.

To work with the files in NetBeans, simply [download the ZIP](https://github.com/mc10/intro-to-java-samples/archive/master.zip), and then import the project with "File -> Import Project -> From ZIP...".

**Note:** Some of the code in these files require the use of Java 8 or later.
